# Collision Detection Sensor
The code prints "Detected..." with onboard LED ON if an object is in the range and sensitivity of adjusted and prints "Safe to go..." with onboard LED OFF if the path is free. We can adjust the sensor range and the sensitivity by turning two potentiometers to clockwise/anticlockwise. Some of the sensors also have small LEDs as indicators.
