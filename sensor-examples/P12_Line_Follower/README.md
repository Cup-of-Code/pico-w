# Line Follower
The code prints "Following the line..." with onboard LED ON if it detects the line in the range and prints "Out of the line..." with onboard LED OFF if it goes out of the path. We can adjust the sensor range and sensitivity by turning the potentiometer clockwise/anticlockwise. Some of the sensors also have small LEDs as indicators.
